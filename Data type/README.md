### Class do not memory consume and object do memory consume

### Python Data type -

- Numeric (Integer, Float, Complex No.),
- Dictionary,
- Boolean,
- Set,
- Sequence type (String, List, Tuple),

# String(immutable)

- String is a collection of one or more characters put in a single quote, double quote, or triple quote. In python there is no character data type, a character is a strig of length one. It is represented by str class. Example: 'hello', "Hello", ""hello""

# List : (mutable)

- List are just like the arrays, declared in other language which is an ordered collection of data. It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type.

# List vs Tuple

- List is mutable and Tuple is mutable

# Dictionary

- is a unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which unlike data type that hold only single value as an element.

- no duplicate key is allowed
- The values is the dictionary can be of any type, while the key must be immutable like number, tuples or string
- Dictionary keys are case sensitives Same key name but with tge different cases are treated as different keys in python dictionaries.
